# ProPoint

The ProPoint is a collaborative text editor specifically built for Coding community to collaborate together to build intresting Softwares. It has some intresting functionality which is very rare in the any other such collaborative editors, one of those is to have an offline interface for collaboration. Since it is offline, users can edit the view of their  documnets in the same way a non-coding editor edits its text field. Inspite of being a collaborative editor it supports all features of a normal text editor like, Saving the document or opening a existing documnt from the PC directly. Our aim is to ease the collaboration between coders.
